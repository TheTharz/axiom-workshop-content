# Problems Using STL Library with Searching

## Problem 1: Finding an Element in a Vector

**Description:** Search for a specific element in a vector using `find`.

## Problem 2: Checking Element Existence

**Description:** Check if an element exists in a sorted vector using `binary_search`.

## Problem 3: Finding Lower Bound

**Description:** Find the position of the first element greater than or equal to a target value using `lower_bound`.

## Problem 4: Finding Upper Bound

**Description:** Find the position just past the last element less than a target value using `upper_bound`.

## Problem 5: Counting Occurrences

**Description:** Count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a vector using `count`.

# Problems Combining 1D Arrays, 2D Arrays, and STL Library

## Problem 1: Maximum Sum Subarray

**Description:** Find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum in a 1D array using Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.

## Problem 2: Transpose of a Matrix

**Description:** Compute the transpose of a square matrix (2D array) using nested loops.

## Problem 3: Sorting Rows of a Matrix

**Description:** Sort each row of a matrix (2D array) individually using `std::sort` from the STL.

## Problem 4: Finding the Kth Smallest Element in a Matrix

**Description:** Given an `n x n` matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order, find the Kth smallest element using binary search combined with matrix traversal.

## Problem 5: Searching an Element in a Matrix

**Description:** Search for a target value in an `m x n` matrix (2D array) where each row and column is sorted in ascending order using binary search.
